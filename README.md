# Item Details Table

This JavaScript code fetches data from an API endpoint and generates a table to display item details. Each row in the table represents an item and includes information such as the name, image, description, purchase date, purchase price, and category.

## Features

- Fetches data from a specified API endpoint.
- Dynamically generates table rows based on the fetched data.
- Formats dates and purchase prices for display.
- Applies different styles to table cells based on the item category.

## Usage

Open the HTML file directly in a web browser, you can do so by simply double-clicking on the HTML file. Here are the steps:

1. Navigate to the directory where the HTML file is located using your file explorer.

2. Find the HTML file named `index.html`.

3. Double-click on the HTML file. It should open the file in your default web browser.

4. Your web browser will render the HTML page, and you should be able to see the item details table generated by the JavaScript code.

   Some browsers may have issues opening the file due to AJAX restrictions. In that case this file has to be served via `localhost` server. 

## Functionality

The JavaScript code consists of several functions:

- `formatDate`: Formats a date string from 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ZZZZ' to 'Month, Day, Year'.
- `formatPurchasePrice`: Formats a purchase price from cents to dollars with two decimal places.
- `getCategoryClass`: Determines the CSS class to apply to the category cell based on the item category.
- `fetchDataAndGenerateTable`: Fetches data from the API, generates table rows based on the data, and populates the table with item details.

## Dependencies

This code does not have any external dependencies. It uses native JavaScript for DOM manipulation and fetch API for data retrieval.

## Compatibility

This code should work in modern web browsers that support JavaScript ES6 features and the fetch API.
